#summary How to use the integrated profiler.

= Enabling the profiler =

In your `settings.py` just add the following:

{{{
ENABLE_PROFILER = True
}}}

= Tuning the results =

The profiler is configured via `settings.py`.

You can restrict the profile to certain functions by specifying a regular expression:

{{{
PROFILE_PATTERN = '.*token.*' # matches all function names containing 'token'
}}}

The maximum number of functions can be set with:

{{{
MAX_PROFILE_RESULTS = 160 # default is 80
}}}

You can change the sorting criteria with:

{{{
SORT_PROFILE_RESULTS_BY = 'cumulative' # default is 'time'
}}}

It's possible to additionally get the callers and callees profile:

{{{
EXTRA_PROFILE_OUTPUT = 'callers' # or 'callees' (you can also provide a tuple with multiple values)
}}}
