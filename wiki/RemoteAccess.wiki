#summary Remote access to the production server.

*This feature is only available in the repository!*

In app-engine-patch we've integrated a remoteapi handler, so *admins* can run manage.py syncdb, manage.py shell, and other commands on the production server:

manage.py shell --remote

All datastore access will be routed to the production server, so you can do migrations or clean up your data, for example.

= Settings =

The following settings are available:

{{{
DATABASE_OPTIONS = {
    # Override remoteapi handler's path (default: '/remote_api').
    # This is a good idea, so you make it not too easy for hackers. ;)
    # Don't forget to also update your app.yaml!
    'remote_url': '/remote-secret-url',

    # !!!Normally, the following settings should not be used!!!

    # Always use remoteapi (no need to add manage.py --remote option)
    'use_remote': True,

    # Change appid for remote connection (by default it's the same as in your app.yaml)
    'remote_id': 'otherappid',

    # Change domain (default: <remoteid>.appspot.com)
    'remote_id': 'otherappid',
}
