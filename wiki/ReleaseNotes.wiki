= Upcoming release (0.4?) =
What's planned:
 * support for all or most generic views (maybe date_based can't be supported because GQL lacks features that are required for an efficient implementation)

= Upcoming release (0.3.4?) =
What's planned:
 * Linux: added shebang to `manage.py`, so you can run it as an executable
 * Windows: the "Program Files" folder and system drive get chosen correctly
 * fixed httplib emulation (e.g., needed by boto)
 * removed custom cache backend
 * added replacements for `get_object_or_404` and `get_list_or_404` shortcuts

*IMPORTANT:* This release will only be compatible with Django 1.0alpha and above. You have to use Django's memcached backend explicitly by adding this to your settings:
{{{
CACHE_BACKEND = 'memcached://'
}}}
The GettingStarted article has been updated with more details.
