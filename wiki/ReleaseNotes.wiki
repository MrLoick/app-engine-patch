= Upcoming release (1.0?) =
What's planned:
 * ported and integrated django-registration into sample app (thank you, Jesaja Everling!)
 * ported !FormSet and Django's native !ModelForm (thank you, Norman Rasmussen!)
 * [MediaGenerator media generator]
 * memcache-optimized session backend
 * added [Profiling profiler] features: analyze only specific requests or a certain percentage of all requests
 * print app-engine-patch version number when running manage.py
 * fixed support for most recent boto release
 * fixed `get_list_or_404` to be consistent with `get_object_or_404`
 * fixed support for file uploads
 * fixed slug support and adjusted redirect keywords in generic views
 * added support for model `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural`
 * refactored and cleaned up code (almost no monkey patches for Django)
 * probably: port of Django's contenttypes app
 * maybe: support for groups and permissions

*Very important:* If you upgrade an existing project please set `DJANGO_STYLE_MODEL_KIND = False` in your settings.py. From now on, the model kind will contain the app name, by default, so multiple apps can define models with the same name, otherwise you get name conflicts. SQL-based Django creates tables with the app label in their name, too. This feature breaks existing models which are stored without the app label, so that's why you need to disable it when upgrading an app.

*Important:* Please upgrade your app.yaml, settings.py, urls.py, and manage.py according to the versions in the sample project, so they contain the features required for [SelfContainedApps self-contained apps].

= Release 0.9.2 (2008-11-19) =
 * updated to Django 1.0.2 ([http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.0.2/ release notes])

= Release 0.9.1 (2008-11-18) =
 * fixed translation support when using a zipped Django package
 * fixed SDK detection via PATH for Linux/OSX

*Important:* Please move "common/django-locale/`*`" to "common/django-locale/locale/" and remove the `LOCALE_PATHS` setting for that folder.

= Release 0.9 (2008-11-16) =
 * updated Django to version 1.0.1
 * support for all `django.contrib.auth` forms and views
 * support for [GoogleAccounts Google Accounts]
 * serialization support
 * `ragendja.dbutils.prefetch_references()` function for optimizing datastore access
 * fixed exception logging
 * fixed a few minor issues

Note: Starting with this release we'll only provide a sample project. If you're updating an existing project please also update your Django version to the one shipped with the sample project.

= Release 0.8 (2008-10-12) =
 * automatic integration of [ZipPackages zip packages]
 * support for boto's SQS implementation
 * djangoforms patch, so you can use lazy translations for verbose_name in model fields
 * httplib workaround for headers that aren't strings (e.g., boto sets them)
 * fixed encodejs escaping in templates
 * you can directly set the value of a KeyReferenceProperty
 * added support for User instances with legacy MD5 hashes that don't have a salt (thank you, Curtis Thompson!)
 * fixed a bug that could rarely cause import errors

*IMPORTANT*: We've renamed ragendja.templatutils to ragendja.templatetags.ragendjatags, so it can be used like any other templatetags library. Please change your imports.

*NOTE*: The sample project now comes with a zipped Django package!

= Release 0.7 (2008-09-04) =
 * Django 1.0 support
 * added a sample project to get you started more easily
 * support for all generic views except for the `date_based` ones which can't be implemented efficiently with the datastore (i.e.: we support `simple.*`, `object_detail.*`, `create_update.*`)
 * `@staff_only` view decorator that renders `no_access.html` if `user.is_staff` is `False`
 * added variable that can be used to check whether we run on the dev_appserver or the real GAE production servers (`from appenginepatcher import on_production_server`)
 * limit number of results in `object_list` generic view to 300, so you won't have problems with timeouts
 * `httplib` should work with most recent SDK
 * `generate_key_name` utility function that allows for generating a `key_name` from a set of values (building a path-like string to uniquely identify an object by its `key_name`)
 * fixed unicode email support

*NOTE:* The `is_banned` field has been moved to the EmailUser model, so the default User is more compatible with Django.

= Release 0.6 (2008-08-15) =
 * `logging.debug` should work if `settings.DEBUG` is `True`
 * `GLOBALTAGS` work without having to import `ragendja.template` (i.e., generic views should be supported, too)
 * `httplib` also works with `manage.py shell`
 * updated code to be compatible with Django 1.0beta1 (sessions, db backend, signals)
 * PATH is searched for a google_appengine SDK installation, too
 * a few simplifications

*IMPORTANT:* This release requires Django 1.0beta1. The version jump (0.3.4 => 0.6) isn't due to new features. The previous version number simply didn't reflect the actual state of the project correctly.

= Release 0.3.4 (2008-07-31) =
 * Linux: added shebang to `manage.py`, so you can run it as an executable
 * Windows: the "Program Files" folder and system drive get chosen correctly
 * fixed httplib emulation (e.g., needed by boto)
 * removed custom cache backend
 * added `get_object_or_404()` and `get_list_or_404()` replacements to ragendja.dbutils
 * added `db_add()` function to ragendja.dbutils (only adds an entity if it didn't exist, yet)

*IMPORTANT:* This release is only compatible with Django 1.0alpha and above. You now have to use Django's memcached backend explicitly by adding this to your settings:
{{{
CACHE_BACKEND = 'memcached://'
}}}
The GettingStarted article has been updated with more details.

Also, we've updated the [Documentation documentation] a little bit, so please take a look!
