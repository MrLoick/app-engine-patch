= Upcoming release (0.4?) =
What's planned:
 * support for all or most generic views (maybe date_based can't be supported because GQL lacks features that are required for an efficient implementation)

= Release 0.3.4 (2008-07-31) =
 * Linux: added shebang to `manage.py`, so you can run it as an executable
 * Windows: the "Program Files" folder and system drive get chosen correctly
 * fixed httplib emulation (e.g., needed by boto)
 * removed custom cache backend
 * added `get_object_or_404()` and `get_list_or_404()` replacements to ragendja.dbutils
 * added `db_add()` function to ragendja.dbutils (only adds an entity if it didn't exist, yet)

*IMPORTANT:* This release is only compatible with Django 1.0alpha and above. You now have to use Django's memcached backend explicitly by adding this to your settings:
{{{
CACHE_BACKEND = 'memcached://'
}}}
The GettingStarted article has been updated with more details.

Also, we've updated the [Documentation documentation] a little bit, so please take a look!
