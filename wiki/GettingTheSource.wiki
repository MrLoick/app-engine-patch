#summary How to get the source code

We use [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/ Mercurial]. Installers are available at http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/BinaryPackages

You can browse the source at http://trac-hg.assembla.com/appenginepatch

To download the latest source code execute this command in a terminal:

hg clone http://hg.assembla.com/appenginepatch

The easiest way to create a patch is by committing it with `hg ci` and exporting it with `hg bundle mypatchname`. Just create a new issue describing your improvement and attach the bundle to the issue. You can alternatively use the [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/MqExtension patch queues extension] and send a normal diff, but that's much more complicated (also more powerful, though).
