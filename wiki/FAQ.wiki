== Why do you use a zipped Django package? ==

The most important reason is that a zipped Django package loads twice as fast as an unzipped Django package. Also, by zipping Django you have more space for your own files.

== Should I use app-engine-patch or django-helper? ==

app-engine-patch is much more complete and more active than django-helper. Also, it's much easier to use (just download and unzip - no need to make a Django package yourself). There really is no reason to use django-helper and follow complicated installation steps.

== Now that Django 1.0 is integrated with the latest App Engine release should I still use app-engine-patch? ==

Yes! The Django 1.0 version that is integrated with App Engine does *not* run out-of-the-box! Basically, you only get the template system. You can't use django.forms, django.contrib.auth, django.contrib.admin, and so on. Also, load times aren't faster because only a minor part of Django is pre-loaded into memory. You still have to load the rest which is what [http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=1695 slows it down].
