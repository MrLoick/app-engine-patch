== Extending app-engine-patch ==

Basically, app-engine-patch is a collection of monkey-patches and a few extra goodies packaged in ragendja. Normally, we manipulate Django's modules, classes, and functions to be compatible with App Engine in our [http://www.bitbucket.org/wkornewald/django-app-engine/ django-app-engine repository].

A few patches can't be integrated directly into Django and are part of the [https://bitbucket.org/wkornewald/appenginepatch-sample/ app-engine-patch sample repository]. As a first step to understand the source code you should first take a look at these files (in "common/appenginepatch"):

 * manage.py
 * aecmd.py
 * appenginepatcher/patch.py
 * main.py


= Sending patches =

In most cases the [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/RebaseProject rebase extension] should be flexible enough to maintain your patches. You can alternatively use the [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/MqExtension patch queues extension] and send a normal diff, but that's more complicated and should be used if you need powerful patch management.

Just send the patch to our [http://groups.google.com/group/app-engine-patch mailing list] or create a new [http://code.google.com/p/app-engine-patch/issues/list issue] and attach your patch.
