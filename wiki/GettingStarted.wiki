#summary Getting started with app-engine-patch and what's different.
#labels Featured,OnlyInRepo

= Requirements =

Please download and install the [http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/ App Engine SDK].

Windows and MacOS X users can just follow the standard installation procedure. Linux users can put the SDK in "/usr/local/google_appengine". If that is impossible you can also put the SDK into any folder that is in the system's PATH environment variable as long as it's called "google_appengine" (this works with any OS).


= Introduction =

We provide a sample project in the [http://code.google.com/p/app-engine-patch/downloads/list downloads] section that comes with app-engine-patch and a zipped Django package pre-installed. You should change `SECRET_KEY` in your settings.py to some random value and set your appid in app.yaml.

Most manage.py commands just work (runserver, test, flush, ...), so you should be in a familiar environment. If you want to upload your website to Google you can run "manage.py update". There's also support for removing unused indexes via "manage.py vacuum_indexes". Note that there is no need to run "manage.py syncdb".

Before continuing please make sure that you've read the:
 * [http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ Django documentation]
 * [http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/ App Engine documentation]


= Updating =

If you want to update an existing project please download the most recent sample project and replace everything in the "common" folder with new versions from the sample project. Also please read the [ReleaseNotes release notes], so you don't miss important changes.


= Differences compared to plain Django =

Most of your Django code should just work. Still, you should know about the following details.


== settings.py ==

Please take the sample project's settings structure as a base and modify it to suit your needs. That's easier than writing the settings from scratch.

Email server settings are only used in the development environment. On the production server you automatically use Google's mail backend. Note that currently Google's SDK doesn't work with gmail accounts and other servers that require TLS. This is a bug in App Engine and we've already filed a bug report.

You can't use the `TransactionMiddleware` due to conceptual differences which make it impossible to implement in App Engine.

The most essential "django.contrib" apps and apps that don't depend on models are supported (auth, sessions, webdesign). The following apps haven't been ported, yet:
 * `django.contrib.admin` (available in repository)
 * `django.contrib.comments`
 * `django.contrib.contenttypes` (partially available in repository; generic relations not supported)
 * `django.contrib.databrowse`
 * `django.contrib.flatpages` (will probably be part of app-engine-patch 1.0)
 * `django.contrib.gis`
 * `django.contrib.redirects`
 * `django.contrib.sites` (will probably be part of app-engine-patch 1.0)


== Models ==

We only support [http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/datastore/ App Engine models] (`from google.appengine.ext import db`). Django models don't work. There are quite a few conceptual differences, especially with transactions, unique properties, and queries, so we can't emulate Django in this area.

For the same reason, Django's `get_xxx_or_404()` functions don't work, but we provide alternatives in [RagendjaDB ragendja.db] with an API that is similar to that of Google's `Model.all().filter()` call.

Starting with app-engine-patch 1.0 the model `kind()` gets prefixed with the app label of the app which defines that model. For example, if you have `myapp.models.MyModel` the datastore will store entities with the following entity name: `myapp_MyModel`. This is needed to prevent conflicts when multiple apps define models with the same name. Note that Django uses this naming scheme, too, when creating SQL tables. If necessary, you can disable that feature in your settings.py:

{{{
DJANGO_STYLE_MODEL_KIND = False
}}}


== Admin interface ==

*Only available in repository!*

If you specify an ordering for a model you have to take care of providing all necessary datastore indexes.

Searches only work on one single property and they're exact, by default. You can prefix the search property name with "@" in which case it's assumed that the property is a !StringListProperty (like it's used in !SearchableModel). The query string is lowercased and split into words and applied via multiple filter() calls (one for each word).


== User model ==

Since there are no unique properties in App Engine the User model doesn't guarantee uniqueness of the `username`.

*Only available in repository:*

Groups and emulated with a !ListProperty storing db.Key objects, but if you use a !ModelForm the user will get a nice selector interface as if it were a !ManyToManyField.

Permissions aren't real models, but just objects which can be converted to a string via permission.get_value_for_datastore(). Permission objects get dynamically generated based on the installed models. In the User model they're stored in a !ListProperty of strings, but !ModelForm will display them with a selector interface as if it were a !ManyToManyField.


== Generic views ==

The `object_list`, `create_update`, and `simple` modules are supported. The `date_based` generic views can't be implemented efficiently on App Engine and thus won't be supported.

If a generic view expects an `object_id` parameter you may provide a number to indicate a key_id or a string to indicate a `key_name` or `str(key)`.

The number of search results shown by `object_list` is limited to 301, so you don't have to mess with datastore timeouts or too large requests. Why exactly 301 results? That's because you probably want to say "more than 300 results" on your search results page. ;) If you want to handle more results than that you have to use a more [http://sites.google.com/site/io/building-scalable-web-applications-with-google-app-engine scalable search method].

The `post_xxx_redirect` parameters provide special access to `%(key)s`, `%(key_name)s`, and `%(key_id)d`.


== Content types ==

*Only available in repository!*

Similar to Permission, content types aren't real models. They get generated dynamically based on the installed models.

Generic relations aren't supported, yet.


= Paths =

The default project handler adds "common/appenginepatch" and "common" to sys.path.
This means that you don't have to specify "common.xxx" in your imports.
For example, you can import something from ragendja like this:
`from ragendja.testutils import ModelTestCase`

Never import `from projectname.appname`, but import `from appname` directly. This also has the advantage that your code becomes more reusable.


= Diving in =

Please read our [Documentation documentation]. There are lots of goodies.
