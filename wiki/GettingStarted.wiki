#summary Installing and using appenginepatch
#labels Featured

Important: You have to use at least Django 1.0alpha (trunk should work, too).

= Installing appenginepatch =

Use the following project structure:

{{{
project root
  app.yaml
  settings.py
  manage.py    (copy from appenginepatch)
  common
    .google_appengine  (only if you use Linux)
    appenginepatch     (copy the whole main folder)
    django             (your custom Django checkout)
}}}

Don't forget to copy manage.py from the appenginepatch folder into your project root. You can only execute it from your project's root folder.

If you're on Linux you can put the App Engine SDK into a folder
".google_appengine" under "common". Windows and Max OS should work out of the
box as long as you use the standard installation paths.

Your app.yaml could look like this:

{{{
application: mycoolapp
version: 1
runtime: python
api_version: 1

handlers:
- url: /media
  static_dir: media

- url: /.*
  script: common/appenginepatch/main.py
}}}

This will use the default main.py handler which should work for most projects.


== IMPORTANT: Paths ==

The default project handler adds "appenginepatch" and "common" to sys.path.
This means that you don't have to specify "common.xxx" in your imports.
For example, you can import something from ragendja directly with:
`from ragendja.testutils import ModelTestCase`

= Differences compared to plain Django =

If you've followed the instructions above most of your Django code should just work. Still, you should know about the following details.

== settings.py ==

All you need to do is add `'appenginepatcher'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`, set `DATABASE_ENGINE = 'appengine'`, and remove all other database settings (host, username, password, etc.).

The cache backend must be enabled with
{{{
CACHE_BACKEND = 'memcached://'
}}}
Unfortunately, this doesn't allow for adding items with infinite timeout. The only way to achieve this is to set a default timeout:
{{{
CACHE_BACKEND = 'memcached://?timeout=0'
}}}

The default (database) auth and session backends automatically get replaced with versions that use the App Engine datastore, so you don't need to change any of your settings. Alternatively, you can specify your own backends as long as they don't depend on unsupported APIs (unsupported: Django models, SQL, sockets).

Email server settings are only used in the development environment. On the production server you automatically use Google's mail backend. Note that currently Google's SDK doesn't work with gmail accounts and other servers that require TLS. This is not our mistake and we've already filed a bug report.

At least the following apps are not supported because they depend on Django's Model class (though, we might eventually provide ported versions):
 * `django.contrib.admin`
 * `django.contrib.comments`
 * `django.contrib.contenttypes`
 * `django.contrib.databrowse`
 * `django.contrib.flatpages`
 * `django.contrib.redirects`
 * `django.contrib.sites`

The following `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` are not supported:
 * `django.middleware.doc.XViewMiddleware` (App Engine limits the HTTP headers you can set)
 * `django.middleware.transaction.TransactionMiddleware` (due to conceptual differences this is impossible to implement in App Engine)

== User model ==

Due to the way the datastore works there is a little problem with properties that must be unique. Our default `User` class does provide a `username` property, but you have to additionally assign a `key_name` and create the user within a transaction that calls `get()` to ensure that the username isn't already taken and only then add the user to the datastore (within the same transaction, of course). This has the problem that username changes become very complicated because an entity's key can't be changed.

Alternatively, you can give up guaranteed uniqueness and mess around with `filter()` to ensure that the username isn't taken. This might be sufficient for most applications.

== Models ==

We only support [http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/datastore/ App Engine models] (`from google.appengine.ext import db`). You have to port all Django Model-based code. There are quite a few conceptual differences, especially with transactions, unique properties, and queries, so we can't really emulate Django's behavior in this area. App Engine has the concept of keys which provide the most efficient way to access an entity. The only way to make use of them is to rewrite your model code. Only model definitions look similar. Read the [http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/datastore/ datastore documentation] for more information.

== Generic views ==

Currently, only `object_list` and 'simple' are supported. We plan to support all generic views in a future release. Note that the `object_detail` generic view's `object_id` parameter may be a number to indicate a key id or a string to indicate a `key_name` or `str(key)` (it tries to `get()` in that order).
