#summary Installing and using appenginepatch

= Installing app-engine-patch & ragendja =

By default, we assume the following project structure:

{{{
project root
  app.yaml
  settings.py
  <project-specific code>
  common
    .google_appengine  (only if you use Linux)
    appenginepatch     (copy the whole main folder)
    django             (your custom Django checkout)
    <reusable code>
}}}

If you're on Linux you can put the App Engine SDK into a folder
".google_appengine" under "common". Windows and Max OS should work out of the
box as long as you used the standard installation paths.

If you don't like the project structure you can use your own, but still put
appenginepatch into a subfolder.

= Using appenginepatch =

Your app.yaml could look like this:

{{{
application: mycoolapp
version: 1
runtime: python
api_version: 1

handlers:
- url: /media
  static_dir: media

- url: /.*
  script: common/appenginepatch/main.py
}}}

This will use the default main.py handler which should work for most projects.


= IMPORTANT: Paths =

The default project handler adds "appenginepatch" and "common" to sys.path.
This means that you don't have to specify "common.xxx" in your imports.
For example, you can import something from ragendja directly with:
from ragendja.testutils import ModelTestCase
