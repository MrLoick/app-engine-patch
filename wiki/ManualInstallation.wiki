You can of course install appenginepatch manually, but it's more difficult than starting with the sample project. Even if you want to use the most recent source directly you can just download the sample project and replace the "common/appenginepatch" folder with a clone of the appenginepatch repository. If you're still not convinced then let's get started:

*Important:* You have to use at least Django 1.0 (trunk should work, too).

Use the following project structure:

{{{
project root
  __init__.py
  app.yaml
  settings.py
  manage.py    (copy from appenginepatch)
  common
    __init__.py
    .google_appengine  (only if you use Linux)
    appenginepatch     (copy the whole main folder)
    django             (your custom Django checkout)
}}}

Don't forget to copy manage.py from the appenginepatch folder into your project root. You can only execute it from your project's root folder.

If you're on Linux you can put the App Engine SDK into a folder
".google_appengine" under "common". Windows and Max OS should work out of the
box as long as you use the standard installation paths.

Your app.yaml could look like this:

{{{
application: mycoolapp
version: 1
runtime: python
api_version: 1

handlers:
- url: /media
  static_dir: media

- url: /.*
  script: common/appenginepatch/main.py
}}}

This will use the default main.py handler which should work for most projects.

In order to reduce the number of files you can delete the following Django folders:
 * django/bin
 * django/contrib/admin
 * django/contrib/comments
 * django/contrib/databrowse
 * django/contrib/flatpages
 * django/contrib/gis
This should work around GAE's 1000 files limit. Alternatively, you can use a zipped Django package.


= Zipping a Django package =

First, read the [ZipPackages zip packages documentation].

If you want to zip Django you have to remove the "django/conf/locale" folder from the zip file because it takes up too much space. Moreover, you can't load translations from a zip file, so you have to move the "locale" folder somewhere else and integrate it via [http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#locale-paths LOCALE_PATHS] in your "settings.py". For example, move the contents of "django/conf/locale" to "common/django-locale" and add this to your "settings.py":
{{{
LOCALE_PATHS = (
    os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'common', 'django-locale'),
)
}}}
Again, the sample project already does this for you. ;)
