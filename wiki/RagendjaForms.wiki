== Using !FormSets with !ModelForm ==

*This feature is only available in the repository.*

`FormSet`s can be used to automatically display data for other models that have a `ReferenceProperty` back to your parent model (or `SelfReferenceProperty`).

The easiest way to use a `FormSet` as part of a `ModelForm` is to add each !FormSet as a `FormSetField` and upgrade your `ModelForm` to a `FormWithSets`.  The `FormWithSets` handles rendering your `FormSets` and makes sure that everything loads and saves correctly.

{{{
class Person(db.Model):
    parent = db.SelfReferenceProperty(collection_name='children_set')

class PersonForm(forms.ModelForm):
    children = FormSetField(Person)

    class Meta:
        model = Person
PersonForm = FormWithSets(PersonForm)
}}}

You can use `PersonForm` as if it were a normal `ModelForm`.
