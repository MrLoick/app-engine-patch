*Important:* This feature only works in the repository.

*Note:* Currently, there is a problem that prevents Django from being used from within a zip package.

In App Engine you can't upload more than 1000 files. In order to work around this limitation you can compress packages into zip files. Note that each file can't be larger than 1MB (yet another App Engine limitation).

In order to simplify the whole process appenginepatch automatically integrates files that you place in a "zip-packages" folder within "common" and/or your project root. For example, if you want to add a zip package for boto you just zip the "boto" root folder (when you open the zip file you should have "boto" in there). Let's assume you've named that file "boto.zip". Now, go to the "common" folder, create a "zip-packages" subfolder, and move "boto.zip" into "zip-packages" ("<root>/common/zip-packages/boto.zip"). That's it. You can now import boto.
